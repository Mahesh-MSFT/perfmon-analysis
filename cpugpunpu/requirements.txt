# Requirements for perfmon3.py - Hardware-accelerated performance analysis
# Core dependencies (same as perfmon2.py)
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0
psutil>=5.8.0
openpyxl>=3.0.0

# Additional dependencies for hardware acceleration
# GPU acceleration (optional - install based on available hardware)
# pyopencl>=2022.1.0  # For OpenCL GPU computing
# cupy>=10.0.0         # For NVIDIA CUDA (if available)

# Hardware detection
# wmi>=1.5.1          # For Windows hardware detection (Windows only)

# Note: Many of these dependencies are optional and should be installed
# based on your specific hardware configuration. The system will
# automatically detect available hardware and use appropriate acceleration.
